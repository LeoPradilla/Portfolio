Hi there! My name is Leonardo Pradilla, and I'm a highly motivated and enthusiastic data science graduate with a passion for using data to drive business decisions. I hold a graduate certificate in Business Analytics from Seneca College.

When I'm not working with data, I like to stay active by running and working out. I also enjoy playing guitar and reading to unwind and stay creative. These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and continue to learn and grow both personally and professionally. 

I have strong problem-solving skills and am dedicated to delivering impactful insights that support better decision-making. I'm a collaborative team player with excellent communication skills and a strong desire to learn from and work with others.

## Projects

### [Tracking the Transition: An Analysis of Fitbit Data Across Borders](https://leopradilla.github.io/FitSleep/)
<p align="justify">The primary objective is to analyzes Fitbit data to evaluate changes in physical activity levels and sleep quality since moving to Canada, with the goal of identifying insights and areas for improvement in their health and wellness.</p>

Skills Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization

<p align="justify">The methodology involved extracting relevant data from the FitBit API, which included physical activity levels and sleep quality metrics. Subsequently, the data was stored in a PostgreSQL database to manage and analyze it efficiently. Python was utilized for statistical analysis and data manipulation. Lastly, visualizations were created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to convey the analysis findings effectively.</p>

<p align="justify">Results: After analyzing the data, I found that my physical activity levels have decreased significantly since moving to Canada, averaging around 8,000 steps per day compared to 12,000 steps per day prior to the move, likely due to less walking and more time spent commuting by car. Additionally, my sleep has been impacted, with an average of 6 hours per night since the move compared to 7-8 hours per night before, likely due to the stress of adjusting to a new country and job. Exploring the FitBit data also revealed interesting insights, such as a correlation between physical activity and heart rate, which could be useful for improving overall health.</p>

### [Expense Explorer: Analyzing Monthly Expenses for Optimal Financial Health](https://leopradilla.github.io/ExpenseExplorer/)
<p align="justify">This project aims to go through the monthly expenses data to understand spending habits and find ways to improve financial health. By sorting and presenting the data in a visual format, we hope to pinpoint where we can cut down on expenses and also where it would be wise to spend more money.</p>
* Extracted information from Google Sheets.
* Used Python to analyze the information.
* Visualized insights in Tableau.
