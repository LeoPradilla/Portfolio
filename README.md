# About me

Hi there! My name is Leonardo Pradilla, and I'm a highly motivated and enthusiastic data science graduate with a passion for using data to drive business decisions. I hold a graduate certificate in Business Analytics from Seneca College.

When I'm not working with data, I like to stay active by running and working out. I also enjoy playing guitar and reading to unwind and stay creative. These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and continue to learn and grow both personally and professionally. 

I have strong problem-solving skills and am dedicated to delivering impactful insights that support better decision-making. I'm a collaborative team player with excellent communication skills and a strong desire to learn from and work with others.
