Hi there! My name is Leonardo Pradilla, and I'm a highly motivated and enthusiastic data science graduate with a passion for using data to drive business decisions. I hold a graduate certificate in Business Analytics from Seneca College.

When I'm not working with data, I like to stay active by running and working out. I also enjoy playing guitar and reading to unwind and stay creative. These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and continue to learn and grow both personally and professionally. 

I have strong problem-solving skills and am dedicated to delivering impactful insights that support better decision-making. I'm a collaborative team player with excellent communication skills and a strong desire to learn from and work with others.

## Projects

### [Tracking the Transition: An Analysis of Fitbit Data Across Borders](https://leopradilla.github.io/FitSleep/)
<p align="justify">The primary objective is to analyzes Fitbit data to evaluate changes in physical activity levels and sleep quality since moving to Canada, with the goal of identifying insights and areas for improvement in their health and wellness.</p>

Skills Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization

<p align="justify">The methodology involved extracting relevant data from the FitBit API, which included physical activity levels and sleep quality metrics. Subsequently, the data was stored in a PostgreSQL database to manage and analyze it efficiently. Python was utilized for statistical analysis and data manipulation. Lastly, visualizations were created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to convey the analysis findings effectively.</p>

<p align="justify">Results: I discovered that since moving to Canada, my physical activity levels have decreased significantly. The number of calories burned decreased by 22% from 61.768 in Colombia to 47.742 in Canada, possibly due to busy work and studies. My sleep duration in Colombia was slightly longer, with a mean duration of 454 minutes compared to 442 minutes in Canada. However, the standard deviation of my sleep duration in Canada is higher than in Colombia, suggesting more variability in sleep duration. These findings indicate the need to improve physical activity levels and maintain a consistent sleep schedule to improve overall health and well-being.</p>
